# Seal of Proof

**The Web3 Certification Platform**

Seal of Proof is an innovative financial system designed to provide secure and verifiable certificates by leveraging blockchain technology's power and immutability. By using Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) as digital certificates, Seal of Proof creates an unalterable record of ownership and verification. 

Seal of Proof is proudly developed and owned by **Nebula Labs**, a collective of developers that aims to create beautiful, interconnected systems in the vast Web3 universe.

## Features

### Privacy Assurance
Before storing certificate data on the blockchain, it is encrypted to protect the privacy of sensitive information. This process involves transforming the original data into an unreadable format using cryptographic algorithms, ensuring that only individuals or systems with the appropriate decryption keys can access the original contents. 

By encrypting certificate data before it is recorded on the blockchain, Seal of Proof maintains confidentiality and prevents unauthorized access, even in a decentralized environment. This layer of security is crucial for applications involving sensitive or personal information, safeguarding against potential breaches and maintaining trust in the system.

### Ownership Proof
NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) represent an innovative leap in the realm of digital assets. They offer a novel method to authenticate and prove ownership of digital certificates through the secure framework of blockchain technology. 

NFTs stand as unique, indivisible entities meticulously stored on a blockchain—a decentralized and distributed digital ledger. This ensures the highest levels of authenticity and security for certificates, providing a transparent and immutable record of ownership that guards against fraud and unauthorized modifications.

When certificates are linked to NFTs, the process of ownership transfer becomes straightforward and efficient. Blockchain technology allows for easy tracking and transparent transfer of ownership, fostering trust among parties involved and enabling seamless verification processes. Holders of such certificates benefit from enhanced security measures and improved accessibility in asset management.

### Immutable Data
Data immutability on a blockchain is a pivotal feature that ensures the security and reliability of information stored within the network. When data are written on-chain, they become a permanent part of the blockchain's ledger due to the inherent design of blockchain technology. 

This immutability is underpinned by the decentralized architecture of blockchains, which distributes ledger copies across numerous nodes within the network. Each block contains a batch of transactions or data entries that, once verified through consensus mechanisms, are cryptographically hashed and encapsulated within a block. 

The cryptographic linkage ensures that altering information within a block would require recalculating hash values for that block and all subsequent blocks—a computationally unfeasible task due to the network's consensus protocols. Furthermore, the distributed nature of blockchains ensures discrepancies or tampering attempts are swiftly identified and rejected. 

Blockchain immutability provides a transparent and verifiable audit trail, making it ideal for applications requiring data integrity, such as financial transactions, supply chain tracking, and digital identity management.

### Decentralized and Transparent
By eliminating intermediaries, users have direct control over their financial records while benefiting from full transparency.

### Reliable Document Export
All application certifications can be exported seamlessly into a PDF format.

## Certification Types

### Balance
Balance Certification is a feature designed to verify and authenticate the balance of digital assets within users' multiple wallet accounts. This feature allows users to ensure the accuracy and legitimacy of their cumulative and individual wallet balances at a given point in time. 

By employing this service, users gain a secure, transparent certification process that facilitates better management of their digital assets across various wallets.
